# Testing using Cypress

- Remember to add this ref component for intellisense or add a jsocnfig.json
    -Add to a cypress testing file `/// <reference types="Cypress" />`

- Also checkout jsconfig.json for vs code configuration and cypress.json for a schema file to help with ide integration
    - jsconfig.json is read with vs code to help with cypress intellisense
    - cypress.json has a schema from their docs to also help!
